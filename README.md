Cookie Security: Authentication cookies are marked as secure and HTTP-only to prevent client-side access.
Protection Against Client-State Manipulation: Sensitive information is stored securely on the server-side.
Testing and Validation: Thorough testing and validation processes have been conducted to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
Future Enhancements: Recommendations for future improvements and security enhancements.
Security Measures
The following security measures have been implemented to protect the website against common web application threats:

Secure User Authentication: Password hashing, salting, and HTTPS encryption are used to secure user credentials.
Session Management: Short-lived session tokens with IP and user-agent validation to prevent session hijacking.
Cookie Security: Authentication cookies are marked as secure and HTTP-only to prevent client-side access.
Input Validation: Validation of user input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
